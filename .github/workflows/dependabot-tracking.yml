name: Dependabot Tracking (Never Runs)

# This workflow exists solely to enable Dependabot tracking for third-party actions
# that are SHA-pinned in our actual workflows for security purposes.
#
# Dependabot does NOT track version updates for SHA-pinned actions. By maintaining
# semantic version references here, Dependabot can alert us to new releases.
#
# This workflow NEVER runs - it is for tracking purposes only.
